A informal proof of the theorem `singleton_law` is provided below, courtesy of Bruno Le Floch https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/458659-Equational/topic/Alternative.20proofs.20of.20E1689.E2.8A.A2E2/near/517189582.  Claude Code was used to formalize this proof using the following steps:

Step 0: Formalize the `S` and `f` notation.

Step 1: First make Lean formalizations of the *statements* of Lemma 1, Lemma 2 and Lemma 3, but leave the proofs as sorries.  Restructure the existing informal proof so that the statement and proof of each lemma is moved to be near the formal statement of that lemma, expressed as a comment.  Use the `S` and `f` notation as needed to align the formal statements with the informal statements.

Step 2a: Create a high-level skeleton for the proof of Lemma 1 by expressing each step of the informal proof as an appropriate Lean statement with justifications given as a sorry (e.g., a step might become a `have` statement that is given by a sorry).  At this stage of the process, do *not* try to justify the entire proof, and accept each step of the informal proof is valid (other than fixing any minor typos or inaccuracies).  If there is a step which is confusing, replace it with an appropriate sorry and let me know what the issue is, rather than spend a lot of time trying to understand it.  Again, take advantage of the `S` and `f` notation as needed to make the formalization match the informal proof as closely as possible.

Step 2b: Assuming no major issues were encountered in Step 2a, fill in all the sorries in the proof of Lemma 1.

Step 3a: Repeat Step 2a for the proof of Lemma 2.

Step 3b: Repeat Step 2b for the proof of Lemma 2.

Step 4a: Repeat Step 2a for the proof of Lemma 3.

Step 4b: Repeat Step 2b for the proof of Lemma 3.

Step 5a: Repeat Step 2a for the final part of the proof of `singleton_law` after Lemma 3.

Step 5b: Repeat Step 2b for the final part of the proof of `singleton_law` after Lemma 3.

Some manual golfing was performed afterwards.

**Lemma 1:** For any a, b, c, one has S_b(a) = a ◇ f(b,c),  i.e., S b a = a ◇ f b c.

*Proof:* For x = S b a and y ∈ Ma we have y ◇ x = a.  Then apply the main equation to these
values of x, y to get
  S b a = a ◇ S z (S b a).
Then set z = S c b and note that (S b a) ◇ z = ((a ◇ b) ◇ b) ◇ ((b ◇ c) ◇ c) = b to simplify
the right-hand side above and get, as announced,
  S b a = a ◇ ((S b a ◇ z) ◇ z) = a ◇ (b ◇ z) = a ◇ f b c.

**Lemma 2:** For all a there exist b, c, d such that f(b,c) = S_d(a),  i.e., f b c = S d a.

*Proof:* By definition of f one has f b c = b ◇ S c b.  Taking b = S x a for some x, and
rewriting b = a ◇ S c b using the first equation in the proof of Lemma 1, we find
  f b c = (a ◇ S c b) ◇ S c b,
which has the desired form for d = S c b.  (Thus, the statement actually holds for all a, c.)

**Lemma 3:** For all a there exists e such that S_e(a) = a,  i.e., S e a = a.

*Proof:* Left-multiply the equation in Lemma 1 by a³ = (a ◇ a) ◇ a to get (the first equality
below comes from the main equation)
  a = ((a ◇ a) ◇ a) ◇ S b a = a³ ◇ (a ◇ f b c).
Take b, c, d as in Lemma 2 to rewrite a ◇ f b c = a ◇ S d a = f a d.  On the other hand,
Lemma 1 with a = b and c replaced by d implies a³ = a ◇ f a d, so overall we get
  a = (a ◇ f a d) ◇ f a d,
which is as desired for e = f a d.

*End of the proof:* For any a, y, using e from Lemma 3, the main equation gives
  a = (y ◇ a) ◇ S e a = (y ◇ a) ◇ a = S a y.
Inserting this back into the main equation gives (z ◇ y) ◇ a = y for any a, y, z.
Thus a ◇ b = ((d ◇ a) ◇ c) ◇ b = c for any a, b, c, d, thus a = b ◇ c = d for any a, b, c, d.
