# Lean 4 Tactic Pitfalls & Workarounds

## `omega`

**Can't see through `abbrev` fields.** `omega` works on concrete `ℤ`/`ℕ` expressions but treats `abbrev`-defined fields as opaque. If `a.m` is definitionally `0` via an `abbrev`, `omega` won't use that.

- Fix: `change n ≥ 0 at hn` or `change n ≥ max 0 N` to expose the literal value before calling `omega`.

## `linarith`

**Handles decimal literals.** `linarith` CAN evaluate `0.1`, `0.8` etc. (OfScientific) — no need to convert to fractions.

**Treats `1/a` and `a⁻¹` as different atoms.** Despite `ring_nf` preprocessing, `linarith` may not normalize `1/(↑K+1)` and `(↑K+1)⁻¹` to the same form. This means `x^(1/(K+1))` and `x^((K+1)⁻¹)` inside rpow are also different atoms.

- Fix: extract facts as `have` with matching notation before feeding to `linarith`. Or use `simp only [one_div]` to normalize.
- Also beware cast grouping: `(K+1:ℝ)⁻¹` elaborates as `↑(K+1)⁻¹` (ℕ add, then cast, then inv), but hypotheses from `simp` typically have `(↑K + 1)⁻¹` (cast, then add, then inv). Use `((K:ℝ)+1)⁻¹` to get the latter form.

## `rw`

**Matches syntactically, not up to definitional equality.** `rw [lemma]` won't fire if the goal has a coercion-wrapped form and the lemma's LHS doesn't.

- Fix: use `change <explicit form>` or `show <explicit form>` to align the syntax first.

**Single `rw [a, b, c]` applies sequentially.** Each rewrite changes the term before the next one matches. If `a` rewrites a subterm that `b`'s LHS mentions, `b` will fail (regardless of whether you split into `rw [a]; rw [b]` — that's identical). Fix by reordering, using `conv` to target specific subterms, or rewriting `b` to match the post-`a` form.

**Can't match through beta-redexes in coerced composed functions.** If a lemma has LHS `(g : Series).abs` with `g : ℕ → ℝ`, then `rw` can match when `g` is a plain variable (`a`) but fails when `g` is a lambda like `fun n ↦ a (f n)`. The series coercion wraps it as `(fun n ↦ a (f n)) n.toNat`, and `rw` can't unify `?g n.toNat` with that beta-redex.

- Fix: use `have heq : <LHS> = <RHS> := by ext; ...` to build the rewrite manually, then `rw [heq]`. The explicit `have` gives `rw` a concrete LHS to match.

## `simp`

**Over-expands `abbrev`s.** `simp` may unfold `abbrev` definitions further than intended, producing raw `if`/`dite` expressions that break subsequent tactic applications.

- Fix: prefer `rw` or `change` for controlled rewriting. Use `simp only [specific_lemmas]` to limit what gets unfolded.

## `positivity`

**Works well with `zpow`.** `positivity` can prove `0 < (10:ℝ) ^ (-n - 1)` and `0 < 1 + (10:ℝ) ^ (-n - 1)` without help.

## Namespace shadowing with `open`

**`open EReal` shadows `ℝ` lemmas.** `EReal` defines its own `abs_mul`, `abs_neg`, `abs_one` etc. When `open EReal` is active, bare `abs_mul` resolves to `EReal.abs_mul` and fails on `ℝ` expressions.

- Fix: use `_root_.abs_mul`, `_root_.abs_neg`, `_root_.abs_one` for the `ℝ` versions.
- General rule: if a `rw` unexpectedly fails to match, check if a namespace is shadowing the lemma.

## Useful lemma patterns

- **zpow monotonicity:** `zpow_le_zpow_right₀ (by norm_num : 1 ≤ a) (by omega : m ≤ n) : a ^ m ≤ a ^ n`
- **Inverting zpow for archimedean bounds:** `inv_lt_comm₀ (by positivity) hε` converts `a⁻¹ < ε` to `ε⁻¹ < a`; combine with `← one_div` to reconcile `ε⁻¹` vs `1/ε`.
- **Even/odd powers of -1:** `pow_mul` + `neg_one_sq` + `one_pow` for `(-1)^(2k) = 1`; add `pow_add` + `pow_one` for `(-1)^(2k+1) = -1`.
